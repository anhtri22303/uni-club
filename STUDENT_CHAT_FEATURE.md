# 🎓 Student Chat Feature - Implementation Guide

## 📋 Overview

The Student Chat feature has been successfully implemented! Students who are members of one or more clubs can now access a real-time chat room for their club(s), just like club leaders.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Detection of Club Membership**
- Students must have at least one club membership (clubId or clubIds in localStorage)
- The Chat menu item automatically appears in the sidebar when the student has club memberships
- Students without club memberships cannot access the chat feature

### 2. **Single Club Support**
- If a student is a member of only one club:
  - The chat automatically connects to that club's chat room
  - No club selector is displayed (seamless experience)
  - Club name is shown in the header

### 3. **Multiple Clubs Support**
- If a student is a member of multiple clubs:
  - A dropdown selector appears in the header with club names
  - Students can switch between different club chat rooms
  - Messages are isolated per club (each club has its own chat room)
  - Auto-selects the first club on page load

### 4. **Real-time Messaging**
- 2-second polling for new messages (same as club leader chat)
- Instant message sending with loading states
- Messages persist for 30 days in Upstash Redis
- Visual indicators for own messages vs. other users' messages

### 5. **Beautiful UI**
- Matches the existing club leader chat design
- Responsive and mobile-friendly
- Avatar support with fallback initials
- Timestamp formatting (relative for today, full date for older messages)
- "Live" badge indicator
- Empty state when no messages exist

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`app/student/chat/page.tsx`**
   - Main chat page for students
   - Club selector for multiple memberships
   - Real-time message polling and sending
   - Handles both single and multiple club scenarios

### Modified Files:
1. **`components/sidebar.tsx`**
   - Added Chat navigation item to student menu
   - Chat appears between "Events" and "Check In"
   - Only visible when student has club memberships (hasClubs = true)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:

```
1. Student logs in → clubIds stored in localStorage ("uniclub-auth")
2. Sidebar checks for clubIds → shows/hides Chat menu item
3. Student clicks Chat → page loads available club IDs
4. Fetch club details from API → display club names in selector
5. Auto-select first club → load chat messages for that club
6. Poll every 2 seconds for new messages
7. Send messages → update local state + backend
```

### localStorage Structure:

```json
{
  "userId": 123,
  "role": "student",
  "clubIds": [1, 5, 7],  // or single clubId: 1
  "email": "student@example.com",
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "token": "jwt_token_here"
}
```

### API Endpoints Used:

- `GET /api/chat/messages?clubId={id}&limit=50` - Fetch initial messages
- `GET /api/chat/poll?clubId={id}&after={timestamp}` - Poll for new messages
- `POST /api/chat/messages` - Send a new message

## 🎯 User Experience

### For Students with ONE Club:

1. Login as student
2. See "Chat" in sidebar (no selector confusion)
3. Click Chat → directly see messages
4. Start chatting immediately

### For Students with MULTIPLE Clubs:

1. Login as student
2. See "Chat" in sidebar
3. Click Chat → see club selector dropdown
4. Select desired club from dropdown
5. Chat messages load for selected club
6. Switch clubs anytime via dropdown
7. Each club maintains its own conversation history

### For Students with NO Clubs:

1. Login as student
2. "Chat" does NOT appear in sidebar
3. If they manually navigate to `/student/chat`:
   - Shows friendly message: "You need to join a club first"
   - Suggests visiting the Clubs page

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

- Protected route: Only students can access `/student/chat`
- Students can only see messages from clubs they're members of
- Each chat room is isolated by clubId
- Authentication required via JWT token

# 2. Check sidebar - "Chat" should appear
# 3. Click "Chat"
# Expected: Chat page opens, no selector, direct access to messages
```

### Test Case 2: Student with Multiple Clubs

```bash
# 1. Login as a student with multiple clubs (clubIds: [1, 5, 7])
# 2. Check sidebar - "Chat" should appear
# 3. Click "Chat"
# Expected: Club selector dropdown with club names

```

### Test Case 4: Real-time Messaging

```bash

# 2. Login as student A in window 1 (club member)
# 3. Login as student B in window 2 (same club member)
# 4. Send message from window 1
# Expected: Message appears in window 2 within 2 seconds
```

### Test Case 5: Cross-role Communication

# Expected: Both see each other's messages in real-time
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Header Section:
- 💬 Chat icon with gradient background
- 📱 Club selector (for multiple clubs)
- 🟢 "Live" badge indicator
- 📋 Current room display (club name)

### Message Area:
- 📜 Scrollable message list
- 👤 User avatars with fallback initials
- ⏰ Timestamp formatting
- 💬 Colored message bubbles (primary for own, muted for others)
- 📭 Empty state with friendly message

### Input Section:
- ✍️ Text input field
- 🚀 Send button with loading spinner
- ⌨️ Enter key support for sending

## 🔄 State Management

The page manages multiple states:
- `availableClubIds`: Array of club IDs from localStorage
- `availableClubs`: Array of club objects with names
- `selectedClubId`: Currently active club chat room
- `messages`: Array of messages for current club
- `latestTimestamp`: For polling new messages
- `loading`, `sending`, `error`: UI states

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Chat menu doesn't appear
**Solution**: Verify that student has clubIds in localStorage:
```javascript
// Check in browser console:
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("uniclub-auth"))
// Should have: clubIds: [1, 2, 3] or clubId: 1
```

### Issue: No messages loading
**Solution**: Check that Upstash Redis is configured in `.env.local`

### Issue: Club names show as "Club #1, Club #2"
**Solution**: Ensure clubs are loaded from API (useClubs hook)

### Issue: Messages not appearing in real-time
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for polling errors
- Verify Redis connection
- Check that both users are in the same club

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- All chat messages are stored in Upstash Redis with a 30-day TTL
- The feature uses React Query for efficient data fetching
- The implementation follows the same patterns as other student pages
