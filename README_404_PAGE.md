## 🏃 How to Run and Test

### Step 1: Start the Development Server

Make sure your Next.js development server is running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or if you're using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The server should start at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 2: Test the 404 Page

You have **4 different methods** to test the 404 page:

#### **Method 1: Use the Test Page (Easiest)**

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/test-404`
2. Click on any of the test buttons
3. Enjoy the 404 page!

#### **Method 2: Manual URL Entry**

1. In your browser, go to any non-existent URL, for example:
   - `http://localhost:3000/this-does-not-exist`
   - `http://localhost:3000/lost-in-space`
   - `http://localhost:3000/random-page-123`

#### **Method 3: Navigate via Link**

Add this link anywhere in your app:

```tsx
<Link href="/some-non-existent-page">Test 404</Link>
```

#### **Method 4: Direct File Access**

You can also view the page directly by navigating to:
- `http://localhost:3000/not-found` (may work in some Next.js configurations)

## 📁 File Structure

```
app/
├── not-found.tsx          # The main 404 page component
└── test-404/
    └── page.tsx           # Test page to easily trigger 404
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

Want to customize the 404 page? Here are some easy tweaks:

### Change Colors

In `app/not-found.tsx`, modify these gradient colors:

```tsx
// Background
className="bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 via-purple-900 to-slate-900"

// Change to:
className="bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 via-indigo-900 to-slate-900"
```

### Change the Message

Update the text content:

```tsx
<h2>Houston, We Have a Problem!</h2>
// Change to your custom message
<h2>Oops! You've Ventured Too Far!</h2>
```

### Add More Floating Objects

Copy and paste this code to add more planets:

```tsx
<div className="absolute top-20 left-20 w-32 h-32 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-br from-green-500 to-emerald-600 opacity-70 animate-float-slow" />
```

### Adjust Animation Speed

Find any animation and change its duration:

```tsx
// Slower
animation: float 10s ease-in-out infinite;

// Faster
animation: float 3s ease-in-out infinite;
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

When you deploy your Next.js app to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), the 404 page will automatically work. Next.js automatically uses `app/not-found.tsx` for all 404 errors.

No additional configuration needed!
